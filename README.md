Introducing FinIQ, a cutting-edge financial intelligence and analytics platform designed to empower personal finance management for Indian households. Built with advanced machine learning models including Random Forest regression and Isolation Forest anomaly detection, FinIQ provides comprehensive insights into spending patterns, budget optimization, and financial health.

Leveraging robust data simulation techniques, FinIQ generates realistic transaction datasets across multiple categories such as groceries, education, healthcare, and entertainment, reflecting the spending behavior of a typical upper-middle-class Indian family earning ₹18-30L annually.

Users benefit from interactive dashboards with beautifully crafted visualizations powered by Plotly, offering deep dives into monthly spending trends, category-wise expense distribution, income versus expenses comparison, and daily spending variability. These insights enable users to identify opportunities for cost reduction, detect unusual transactions, and formulate data-driven budgeting strategies.

The platform integrates seamless reporting capabilities allowing export of detailed transaction history, financial summaries, and predictive analytics in Excel, CSV, and JSON formats—facilitating professional-grade financial documentation.

FinIQ's intuitive and sleek interface, designed on Streamlit, ensures a user-friendly experience with real-time feedback, anomaly alerts, and AI-powered recommendations tailored specifically to the Indian financial context.

Through this project, I have demonstrated the power of combining machine learning, advanced analytics, and interactive visualization to create practical tools that enhance financial decision-making and promote fiscal responsibility.

FinIQ stands as an exemplar for modern financial analytics platforms, blending technical sophistication with usability—offering valuable insights that drive improved financial outcomes.
